# SerialQuotes

Nowadays is hard to keep track of every single one piece of media that is aired,
specially when you are a fan of pop culture and you want to buy or recommend to other
users every single series or movies of your favorite franchise with qotes. This is why an application to
manage viewed content and review it with quotes in order to recommend it to other users is needed, that is why
we created SerialQuotes.
